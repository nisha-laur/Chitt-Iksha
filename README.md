# Chitt-Iksha
<strong><h1>Overview</h1>
 <p>Chittiksha is a one stop website which caters all the issues faced by a person who is suffering mentally .Many websites can be found on web which just connects you with a mentor and allows you to attend paid sessions but here we first provide you with all the resources which will provide useful to overcome that mental issue and additionally we connect you with the volunteers  who willingly listen to your problems and with their experience try to provide you with solution that too without charging a single penny.</p>
 <h1>Inspiration</h1>
 <p>We are surrounded by our friends and family but most of the time we don't find the right person to share our mental health with because your mental state and emotions might not be understood by the rest and fear of getting judged by our known ones  and peers is always there  and therefore you look out for someone who is undergoing through the  same phase with whom you can share anything without the fear of  getting  judged since they are strangers to you. Me  during my 1st year in college went  through low phase many times and I found it really difficult to open up to my friends and even my family members I remember crying at nights  because of my inability to express my emotions to my known ones  and then I went online to seek some company and found many  websites where chatting and video calling features were available but there  no one was present with the intention of helping me  or hear out to my emotions there I felt the need of creating this website which is a one stop solution to all mental health related issues.
What it does: Our motto with this website is to provide aid in every possible way to people who are suffering from any mental health related issues. We have sectioned our website into three age groups according to set of similar issues we believe they  face , all the resources are therefore in accordance with these age groups. It provides the user with various tools such as a community of similar aged people ,bunch of resources like podcasts, articles ,and book recommendation also we believe in meditation practices so we provide the user with a meditation room as well We have kept a ‘register as volunteer’  option  on our home page to connect  the person who wants to assist the needy therefore, the user when joins the comminuty like discord server their they are helped by the volunteers  who are experienced in that particular problem domain.</p>
